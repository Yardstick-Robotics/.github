## About

Our mission: build robots to perform where most can’t — enabling industries to overcome labor shortages, boost efficiency, and operate safely in the most extreme conditions.  
YardStick Robotics, a subsidiary of Rheinmetall AG, brings automation to environments long excluded from technological progress – extreme, dangerous, and unpredictable situations.  
With cutting-edge AI, rugged hardware, and a modular system architecture, we deliver scalable solutions for unstructured and challenging environments.
